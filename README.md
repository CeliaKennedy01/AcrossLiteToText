# Crossword: Across Lite .puz to text file converter

This .Net Core console application converts one or more Across Lite .puz files into their text file equivalents.

It can be compiled to run on Windows, Macs, or Unix computers. (Separate installation of the [.Net Core runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1 ".Net Core runtime") may be required.)

It can be edited here on the web, using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ "Visual Studio") (the free version works fine), or if you're one of the cool kids, on [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ "Visual Studio Code") which also runs on Windows, Macs, or Unix.

The code includes a simplified version of core functionality from [XWord Info](https://www.xwordinfo.com "XWord Info") to parse the binary file and convert it to text. You now have a great head start if you want to research crossword data, create your own solving app, or even build your own XWord Info competitor!

Anyone interested in contributing to this project is welcome to submit a pull request. For more information, contact me via the email link on the [XWord Info](https://www.xwordinfo.com "XWord Info") home page.

If there is interest, more XWord Info core functionality will be moved to Open Source over time.
